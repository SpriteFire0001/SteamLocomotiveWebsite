<p>Built in 1938 at Doncaster Works to Nigel Gresley's design, LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard is a 4-6-2 ("Pacific") steam locomotive intended for use on the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). Because of its streamlined and wind tunnel tested[1] design, it was able to transport long-distance express passenger services quickly. With a speed of 126 mph (203 km/h), Mallard broke the steam locomotive world record on July 3, 1938, and it remains in place to this day.</p>
<p>Although regular steam-hauled rail services in the UK were officially restricted to a 90 mph "line speed" during the British Railways era, the A4s frequently had to exceed this speed in order to maintain schedules on trains like the Silver Jubilee and The Coronation, with their engines reaching speeds of up to 100 mph.Before being retired in 1963, the Mallard travelled nearly a million miles (2.4 million km).</p>
<p>With the tender included, the locomotive measures 70 feet (21 metres) in length and weighs 165 long tonnes (369,600 pounds). It has steel rims and red wheels that are painted an LNER garter blue colour.</p>
<p>Mallard is currently housed at the National Railway Museum in York as a part of the National Collection.</p>
