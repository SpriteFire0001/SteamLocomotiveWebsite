<p>Completed in 2008, LNER Peppercorn Class A1 No. 60163 Tornado is a 4-6-2 steam locomotive designed originally by Arthur Peppercorn. After the original batch was scrapped, it is the only remaining Peppercorn Class A1, and the first new build British mainline steam locomotive since 1960. The first steam locomotive to officially reach 100 mph (160 km/h) on British tracks in more than 50 years was Tornado in 2017.</p>
<p>Following the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust's 1990 founding of the project, Tornado's construction started in 1994 and was primarily carried out at Darlington Works, with some components being manufactured in other locations. The project's funding came from sponsorship agreements, public donations, fundraising events, and Tornado's own special services hire. January 2009 saw the locomotive receive its mainline certificate after it was built in accordance with contemporary safety and certification requirements.</p>
<p>Between 2008 and 2022, the locomotive operated on heritage and mainline trains throughout Britain before being removed for maintenance.</p>
