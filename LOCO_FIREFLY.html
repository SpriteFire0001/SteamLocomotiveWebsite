<p>John Mosse designed the replica 'Firefly' locomotive, and it took him about 20 years to bring it to the final state seen in the picture.</p>
<p>Construction of the chassis commenced in Bristol, before being moved to the Didcot Railway Centre where it was completed.</p>
<p>When the steam chests were connected to a compressed air line on December 19, 2002, after the chassis was finished and the driving wheels were jacked up clear of the rails, it was an especially thrilling event.  The wheels turned over, much to the surprise and delight of someone present.  After trying it in both the front and rear gears, it was allowed to run in forward motion for an hour while applying 15 psi and turning over at a rate of about 5 r.p.m.</p>
<p>Though it had been assembled and passed its boiler test for some time, the boiler, built by Israel Newton & Sons, was first fired up on October 10, 2002.</p>
<p>As the sixty-third member of the 'Fire Fly' class, it has the original style of gab valve gear, with two eccentrics located centrally on the crank axle to drive the gabs for the front gear and eccentrics outside the cranks for the back gear.  There is only one reversing lever that controls the gabs.  Later, Gooch Gear was installed on the GWR locos in place of this gear because the Gab gear prevented any reduction in cutoff.</p>
<p>On Saturday, April 3, 2005, 'Firefly' received its first public steaming at its home base at the Didcot Railway Centre, making it a red-letter day.  Actor Anton Rogers broke a bottle of champagne on the locomotive to officially launch it into service. After that, the new 'Firefly' began making passenger trips up and down the broad gauge track at Didcot on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The 'Firefly Trust', many of whom are well-known BGS members, is currently responsible for maintaining this locomotive.</p>
<p>At Didcot, "Firefly" has occasionally been steam-driven, transporting passengers in a third-class passenger truck.</p>
