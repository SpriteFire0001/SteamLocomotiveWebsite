<h1>Locomotion No.1</h1>

<img src = "LOCOMOTION_1_1.jpg" height = "100%">
<p>This is the first railway engine with steam power to operate on a public track. George Stephenson created it, and it ignited a revolution in transport that changed people's lives and fortunes in Britain and around the globe.</p>
<p>Although we now take it for granted that we can hop on a train and go anywhere in the nation, inland transport in the early 1800s was mostly provided by canal boats and horse-drawn carriages. Everything changed with the development of the steam engine. The original purpose of steam engines was to provide haulage power and pumps for use in mining operations. Steam locomotive prototypes first appeared in the coal and ironworks areas of South Wales and Shropshire. The renowned Stockton & Darlington Railway opened in the northeast of England, ushering in the era of rail travel. This was a public steam-hauled railway that could transport both passengers and cargo. It was the world's first of its kind.</p>
<p>People came in large numbers to see the opening on September 27, 1825. It was unlike anything they had ever seen. Locomotion I, driven by George Stephenson himself, pulled coal and flour waggons as well as the unique passenger carriage known as Experiment. It is estimated that the train reached 15 mph.</p>
<p>The Stockton and Darlington Railway's success, together with the need for more transport options and an abundance of capital, resulted in the development of a global network of railways that revolutionised Britain. Now, goods could be shipped to coastal ports and across the nation quickly and cheaply. People from all walks of life travelled to previously unreachable areas for work, business, and pleasure as new towns and industries quickly grew.</p>
<p>Not everybody was a fan of the railroads. Landowners and farmers objected, saying they could scare livestock and ruin milk by making it sour and preventing hens from laying. Others were worried that the nation's core moral values might be threatened by the free movement of the lower classes!</p>
