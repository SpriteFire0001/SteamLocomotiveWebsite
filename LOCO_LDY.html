<p>The Ffestiniog Railway spent fifteen years building the narrow gauge steam locomotive Lyd in their Boston Lodge shops. </p>
<p>Lyd is modelled after the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway Locomotive E188 Lew, which Manning Wardle constructed in 1925 for the Southern Railway, which at the time was the line's owner.</p>
<p>Lew was the only L&amp;B loco, having been in service since 1898, to be kept in service after the line closed in 1935. He was used to disassemble the line before being transported to South America (possibly Brazil) and facing an uncertain future.</p>
<p>Lyd shares an external appearance with Lew, but in order to increase overall efficiency, Lyd uses a number of contemporary design and construction techniques. Lyd's cab has detachable side panels that allow him to alter the roof profile and navigate the Garnedd tunnel.</p>
<p>On May 2, 2010, Lyd was steam-rolled for the first time at Ffestiniog's Quirks and Curiosities event. In July 2010, Lyd was repainted with a black primer coat. Lyd hauled a test train for the first time on August 8, 2010, and it hauled a passenger train for the first time during the 2010 Superpower Weekend on the Welsh Highland Railway. Following a visit to Woody Bay on the Lynton & Barnstaple for their Autumn Gala Weekend in September 2010, Lyd made a visit to the Launceston Steam Railway on the weekend of September 18â€“19, 2010. Accompanying him were Ffestiniog coach 102 and ex-Lynton & Barnstaple coach 15, which is currently renamed as coach 14.</p>
