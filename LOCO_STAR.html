<p>Completed in 1960, the preserved British steam locomotive 92220 Evening Star is registered under the BR Standard Class 9F number. It was the final steam locomotive that British Railways produced. As of the time of construction, it was the only main line steam locomotive in Britain designated for preservation. It was the British Railways Standard range's 999th locomotive.</p>
<p>92220 was utilised on the Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway line as well as the Western Region. Serving as a heavy goods locomotive was its primary function. 92220, however, was never just any locomotive; instead, due to the unique workings and exhibitions for which the engine was needed, its operation was strictly regulated "to ensure she returned home regularly for cleaning and maintenance."</p>
