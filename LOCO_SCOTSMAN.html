<h1>The Flying Scotsman</h1>
<img src = "FLYING_SCOTSMAN_1.jpg" height = "100%">
<p>Built in 1923 at Doncaster Works for the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman is a 4-6-2 "Pacific" steam locomotive designed by Nigel Gresley. It was used by LNER and its successors, British Railways' Eastern and North Eastern Regions, on long-distance express passenger trains on the East Coast Main Line. Most notably, it was used on The Flying Scotsman service between London King's Cross and Edinburgh Waverley, for which it was named.</p>
<p>As the LNER's flagship locomotive, 4472 hauled the first non-stop Flying Scotsman service in 1928 and twice represented the company at the British Empire Exhibition. On November 30, 1934,[1] it became the first locomotive to reach the officially recognised speed of 100 miles per hour (161 km/h). On August 8, 1989, while in Australia, it set the record for the longest non-stop run, covering 422 miles (679 km). Both of these records were set for steam traction.</p>
<p>After travelling 2.08 million miles and retiring from British Railways in 1963, Flying Scotsman gained significant notoriety for preservation while owned by Tony Marchington, Alan Pegler, William McAlpine, and, since 2004, the National Railway Museum. In addition to hauling enthusiast specials in the UK, the locomotive undertook extensive tours in the US, Canada, and Australia in 1988 and 1989, as well as the US and Canada from 1969 to 1972. Some have called the Flying Scotsman the most well-known steam locomotive in the world.</p>
