<h1>Stephenson's Rocket</h1>

<img src = "ROCKET_1.jpg" height = "100%">
<p>An early steam locomotive with a 0-2-2 wheel arrangement is called Stephenson's Rocket. It was constructed for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway's (L&amp;MR) October 1829 Rainhill Trials, where it competed and triumphed to prove that upgraded locomotives would outperform stationary steam engines.</p>
<p>Robert Stephenson created the design and construction of Rocket in 1829 at his company's Forth Street Works in Newcastle upon Tyne. </p>
<p>Though Rocket was by no means the first steam locomotive, it was the first to bring together several innovations to produce the most advanced locomotive of its day. It is the most famous example of an evolving design of locomotives by Stephenson that became the template for most steam engines in the following 150 years. </p>
<p>Up until 2018, the preserved locomotive was on display at the Science Museum in London. Following that, it was moved to the National Railway Museum in York. It has been housed at the Locomotion Museum in Shildon since 2023.</p>

<p>Constructed as a trial model to secure victory in a speed competition, the engine was quickly surpassed by more advanced concepts, like Stephenson's 1830 Northumbrian and Planet designs.</p>
<p>The Rocket itself had undergone significant modifications in a matter of years to resemble the Northumbrian class. In addition to having a drum smokebox, the locomotive also had its firebox capacity increased and its shape simplified. The cylinder arrangement was changed from being angled to nearly horizontal. The engine of today has these configurations. The Engineer magazine came to the conclusion that "it seems to us indisputable that the Rocket of 1829 and 1830 were totally different engines" in 1884, based on the extent of the changes made to the engine in 1829.</p>
