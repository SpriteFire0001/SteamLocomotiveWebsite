<p>"Saint" GWR 2900 Class No. 2999 In 2019, Lady of Legend, a 4-6-0 steam locomotive designed by George Jackson Churchward, was completed. It was built mostly at the Didcot Railway Centre in Didcot, Oxfordshire, and was based on the frames and boiler of 4900 "Hall" Class No. 4942 Maindy Hall. The project, known as "building the 78th Saint," began in the 1970s with the goal of creating a new "Saint" because none of the original class members had been saved.</p>
<p>A 4-6-0 locomotive of the GWR's 4900 Hall class, No. 4942 Maindy Hall. It was constructed in Swindon in 1929. It was taken out of service in 1963 and moved to the Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, South Wales (Vale of Glamorgan). In 1964, it was acquired by the Didcot Railway Centre, who also purchased 5900 Hinderton Hall, in 1974.</p>
<p>Since none of the original class members were saved (the last class member being no 2920 Saint David, which was withdrawn from service in October 1953 and sent straight for scrap), a plan was formulated to build a new 2900 Saint following the formation of the society in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Rebuilding 4942 Maindy Hall from scrapyard condition was decided upon (ten additional members of the 4900 Hall class remain in preservation). This makes sense because the original 1925 4900 class prototype was derived from the Saint Martin 2900 class engine. The decision was made to assign the locomotive a new class number, 60163 Tornado, in order to replace the highest-numbered original Saint, No. 2998, Ernest Cunard. A number of Saints from an early production lot had names derived from historical, mythological, or poetical "Ladies," which is consistent with the Lady of Legend designation for 2999.</p>
