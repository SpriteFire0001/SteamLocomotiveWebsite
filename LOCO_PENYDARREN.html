<p>Richard Trevithick worked for Samuel Homfray, the proprietor of the Penydarren Ironworks in Merthyr Tydfil, in 1803. To move iron from Penydarren to the closest canal, Trevithick was asked to build a locomotive. As early as February 1804, the Penydarren locomotive was prepared for its maiden voyage. Ten tonnes of iron, seventy passengers, and five waggons were successfully transported from the Penydarren ironworks to the Merthyr-Cardiff Canal on February 21st. The Penydarren locomotive reached nearly five miles per hour during the nine-mile trip.</p>
<p>With its 8-foot flywheel, single vertical cylinder, and long piston-rod, the Penydarren locomotive was the first steam engine to operate effectively on rails. In order to create a draught that more forcefully pulled the hot gases from the fire through the boiler, Trevithick's locomotive used the crucial principle of turning the exhaust steam up the chimney.</p>
<p>Trevithick's Penydarren locomotive only made three journeys. Each time the seven-ton steam engine broke the cast iron rails. Samuel Homfray came to the conclusion that Trevithick's invention was unlikely to reduce his transport costs and so he decided to abandon the project.</p>
