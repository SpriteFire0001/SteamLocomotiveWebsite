<p>The preserved Great Western Railway Hall class locomotive 5972 Olton Hall gained notoriety when it was portrayed pulling the Hogwarts Express in the Harry Potter film series.</p>
<p>No. 5972 was built for the Great Western Railway (GWR) at Swindon Works in April 1937. It was initially assigned to Carmarthen, South Wales, where it stayed until 1951. It was given to Plymouth Laira after being outfitted with a three-row superheater at Swindon Works. It was last assigned to Cardiff East Dock as a shed before being removed in December 1963 and then sold for scrap to Woodham Brothers, Barry in May 1964.</p>
<p>The locomotive was sold by Woodham Brothers to David Smith, and in May 1981 it was moved to the Horbury Railway Works in Wakefield. It was moved to Carnforth MPD in 1994 for restoration, and in 1998 it was steam-tested for the first time.</p>
<p>The locomotive is shown in the Harry Potter films pulling the imaginary Hogwarts Express, which consists of four (later five) British Rail Mark 1 carriages. In addition to internal train scenes, scenes were shot at the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, the Glenfinnan Viaduct, and King's Cross railway station.</p>
<p>No. 5972 is occasionally assigned tasks apart from its "Hogwarts" responsibilities. It was temporarily relocated to the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway in May 2009, and it was stationed at Tyseley Locomotive Works in July 2009 for use on some of Vintage Trains' summertime Shakespeare Express trains. In 2010, it made a comeback to the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway for their yearly Wizard's Weekend celebration. The locomotive was on static display in London's Hyde Park towards the end of 2011. On June 7th and July 12th, 2014, it worked two last Wizards Express rail tours from Manchester to York just before its boiler and mainline certificate expired. 5972 worked the trains between Carnforth and York in both directions (as far as Hellifield on the return leg of June's trip).</p>
